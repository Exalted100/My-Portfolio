            <p className="about-p">George Brecht said "the whole universe interests me." I think that is the easiest way to describe myself. George was a professional chemist, an artist, and a composer. I am a law student, a writer, and a web developer. One of my most recurring thoughts is how I can take all the knowledge of my past and make them contribute to whatever it is I am currently doing (which is hopefully developing a website for you soon). I have built many interesting things personally. But like everyone else, I want something more. Something practical, that stands the test of time, that people use.</p>
            <p className="about-p">I have spent years honing my soft skills. I have possess communication, knowledge of collaborative tools such as notion and slack, and I work well in teams. I am able to work with little supervision. I can stay at tasks until I understand what needs to be done and do it well. At the same time, I understand that no one knows everything, especially as I am inexperienced as a web developer. I know that I should ask those with more knowledge than me the important questions that need asking.</p>
            <p className="about-p">I am constantly working to improve both my coding skills and my problem solving skills. I do these by working on new projects. I also use Code Wars and Hacker Rank to solve algorithm problems. By doing these, theoretical concepts become clearer and more pragmatic for me. Recently, I have begun documenting my experiences. I have a background in writing and documenting helps me make the techniques I have used to solve problems clearer in my mind. You can read about my experiences in the Blog section.</p>
