            <p className="about-p">George Brecht said "the whole universe interests me." I think that is the easiest way to describe myself. George was a professional chemist, an artist, and a composer. I am a law student, a writer, and a web developer. Other things I'm interested in include product management, finance, and enterpreneurship. One of my most recurring thoughts is how I can take all the knowledge of my past and make them contribute to whatever it is I am currently doing. I have built many things I find interesting. But I want to build more. Something practical, that stands the test of time, that people use.</p>
            <p className="about-p">I have spent years honing my soft skills. These include communication, team work, and knowledge of collaborative tools. Learning to code on my own has helped me improve my self-management, with many of my projects done without supervision. This is possible by staying at tasks until I undertsand them. At the same time, I ask questions. I realize that I should ask others the important questions that need asking. I carry out a series of tests and my own attempts to solve the problem. This way, when I ask questions, I can also add what I've found does not solve my problem. I've noticed that this helps people answer my questions much more quickly and easily.</p>
            <p className="about-p">I am constantly working to improve my knowledge of web development. I do this by working on new projects. I also use Code Wars and Hacker Rank to solve algorithms. Solving algorithms make theoretical concepts clearer and more pragmatic for me. Recently, I have begun documenting my experiences. I have a background in freelance writing and editing. Documenting helps me make the techniques I have used to solve problems clearer in my mind. You can read about my experiences in the Blog section.</p>
