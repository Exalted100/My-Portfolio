            <p className="about-p">George Brecht said "the whole universe interests me." I think that is the easiest way to describe myself. George was a professional chemist, an artist, and a composer. I am a law student, a writer, and a web developer. One of my most recurring thoughts is how I can take all the knowledge of my past and make them contribute to whatever it is I am currently doing (which is hopefully developing a website for you soon). I have built many interesting things personally. But like everyone else, I want something more. Something practical, that stands the test of time, that people use.</p>
            <p className="about-p">My most striking skills are being able to learn fast and being able to work fast. I have also spent several years working on my soft skills. I work well on teams. I work well with little to no supervision. I am also able to mostly figure stuff out on my own. And when I can't, I realize there is no shame in asking questions. </p>
            <p className="about-p">It is tempting to say I spend all my time writing codes. But in reality, I spend more time thinking of writing codes than actually writing codes. I usually have an idea of what and how to recreate a design I want to, even before my fingers touch the keyboard. I can tell you I think about writing codes very often though, and I would be being honest. Long after I leave websites, I will think of how the developer made their hamburger toggle how it did. And then I will go to Google or YouTube, and search something I think will bring up answers.</p>
